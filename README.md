# json-api-task
Three pages using JS were represented (manipulating DOM elements, not different pages themselves):
- First Page: Table that represents data (List page)
- Second page: this page is accessed by clicking on the data-line on the table (details page)
- Third page: this page is accessed by clicking the 'create new record' button (New record form).

Made these endpoints using free JSON API's:
- Fetch data (GET): https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Fetch one data details (GET): https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{ID}
- Add new record/data (POST): https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
